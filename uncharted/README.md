# Uncharted

Uncharted is a core package used by [Uncharted Phoenix](../uncharted_phoenix) to define data structures and functions needed to prepare a chart for rendering. This is a separate core library from the phoenix LiveView package because we anticipate also building a Scenic library adapter (and possibly more). For information about how to use Uncharted as an end user trying to make a chart show in Phoenix, please visit [Uncharted Phoenix](../uncharted_phoenix).

For more information about this core library, please visit the [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/uncharted/readme.html).
